We are looking for someone who can create a unique goal bar.

We created a really bad example image, but hopefully this will help visualize it.

There is already a flame CSS effect that looks great animated that we would like the goal bar to be developed from.

We have not found any burnt effects. Hoping you can come up with a nice looking quality burnt effect.

Goal bar properties 610 x 45px
1-100% normal goal progress bar
101-200% Gradual increasing animated flame with different layered colors based on percent
201-300% Gradual increasing burnt effect of goal bar (most of the goal bar will be visible in the background) based on percent
